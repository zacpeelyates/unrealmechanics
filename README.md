>Portals

This is the cool one. You can see through and walk through and throw stuff through and it feels pretty seamless (there is about 1 frame of lag atm). 
I also have some cool non-euclidian illusion demos in the project which is very fun.
TODO: make it so that only portals on screen try to render for performance, currently only the closest portal to you renders so we dont melt the gpu running a bunch of cameras.

>Box Stuff

pick up box, throw box, see how the box is gonna go before you throw it, change how you throw it. nice.

>Player/Camera controller

Third person or first person camera with a lot of cool mainpulations like leaning, orbiting, toggling collisions with environment. Its basically a selfie stick attached to you that you can move every which way. 
Can also control whether or not you rotate the player with the camera.

>Reaperport 

cast out a ray that will teleport you to a position like overwatch reaper guy. Snaps to ledges and checks for valid ground position before teleporting.

>Doors

Have you ever wondered what the essence of a door is. We have that here. Door base Actor class distills what it means to be a door. Example expansion classes included for a million different door types.
